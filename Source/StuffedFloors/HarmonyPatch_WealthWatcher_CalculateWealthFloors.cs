     * The vanilla game stores cached market values in WealthWatcher.cachedTerrainMarketValue,
     * and indexes this list by def.index. Somehow, even though this cache is initialized after
     * our terrains are generated, these indexes are out of sync. I suspect this is caused by 
     * subclassing TerrainDef with FloorTypeDef. 
     * 
     * Regardless, the cache is fairly pointless, as we don't need to check value for every cell
     * like vanilla does, we only need to check it for each unique terrainDef. In addition, this
     * routine is performed once every 5000 ticks, so less than once per minute. Looping over a 
     * map isn't _that_ expensive, so the below approach is simplified.
